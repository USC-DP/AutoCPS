# AutoCPS

Automatically generate sementically different random flight software of varying
quality. This repo contains the prototype for the workshop paper, which is split
into two primary parts: an autocoder library and a flight software skeleton.

## Quick Start

Make sure all the requirements are installed and then run `make`. This will run
a script in the autocoder library that builds every possible flight software for
one such physical system.

## Autocoder Library

More information on the autocoder library and more informative usage
instructions can be found in [autocoder/README.md](autocoder/README.md).

## Flight Software

More information on the FSW and can be found in [fsw/README.md](fsw/README.md).

## Requirements

*Python 3.5 or newer with Sympy

*Any relatively recent Clang and GCC

*CMake 3.19 or newer
